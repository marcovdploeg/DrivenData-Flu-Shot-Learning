# DrivenData-Flu-Shot-Learning

This repository contains the code to obtain my results for the Flu Shot Learning practice competition on DrivenData.

Applied methods in this script are: machine learning using xgboost, preprocessing (imputation, one-hot encoding, ordinal encoding), ROC AUC scoring, hyperparameter optimisation.
